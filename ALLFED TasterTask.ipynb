If a solely urban area is investigated, the factor is corrected by an increase of 10% as described above. An area is considered primarely urban if the population density calculated from the inputs surpasses 680 people per km². This number is based on a comprehensive review of population density data for countries. Most countries, excluding city states, count with a population density below 680 people per km², so it can be reasonably assumed that an area surpassing this value is either a city state or an urban region."
